# NaiveBayesClassifier-IRIS-Dataset
In the iris dataset ,we are finding the classification report and the confusion matrix by the self naive bayes Implementation and the inbuilt gaussian naive bayes classifier.
Firstly the data of X is converted into the format of 0 1 2 3 so that it is not variable and get easily accepted by the naive bayes classifier.
Then we are implementing fit predict function for the IRIS dataset
At last finding the confusion matrix using sklearn
The accuracy obtained by the gaussian inbuilt sklearn classifier is 0.87 .Precision =0.90 and Recall=0.87
The accuracy obtaiined by the self inbuild skelarn classifier is 0.95+. Precision=0.98 and Recall=0.97
